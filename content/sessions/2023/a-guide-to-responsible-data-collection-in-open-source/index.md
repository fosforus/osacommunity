Collecting usage data in open source can be a controversial topic, but attitudes on this topic have been notably shifting recently. After working with many open source projects and companies over the past 4 years, our team at Scarf has established empirically successful best practices and considerations that all open source projects should be aware of to effectively track the usage of their software. This talk will discuss a breadth of considerations including:
 * Community messaging and expectation management
 * Security & privacy
 * Compliance
 * Ethics
 * Governance
