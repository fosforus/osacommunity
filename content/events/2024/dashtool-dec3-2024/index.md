<p>As Iceberg Materialized Views are being standardized, they have the potential to revolutionize the way we approach analytical data transformation by combining the simplicity of views with the performance of tables. In this session, we introduce Dashtool, an open-source data build tool specifically designed for Iceberg Materialized Views.</p>
<p>With Dashtool, you can write declarative SQL SELECT statements, similar to dbt and SQLMesh, and automatically generate the corresponding Iceberg Materialized Views. Moreover, Dashtool also enables you to create workflows for orchestrators, ensuring that your Materialized Views stay up-to-date with the latest data. By leveraging only open-source tools, Dashtool streamlines ingestion, transformation, and orchestration, making it an essential tool for anyone working with Iceberg Materialized Views.</p>
