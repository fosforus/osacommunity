<p>Modern BI tools like Apache Superset promise quick insights through interactive, no-code dashboards. However, they often fail to deliver due to the unsatisfactory performance and limited capabilities of the query engines that power them. This session will explore the essential capabilities query engines must possess to achieve the BI performance everyone hopes for, but few often get, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast and flexible Ad-hoc Queries: Run complex SQL queries on the fly without extensive pre-computation for interactive data analysis.</li>
<li>On-demand query acceleration: Enable your underlying engine to add pre-computations on demand without manual SQL rewriting.</li>
<li>Support for open formats: Integrate with open formats to simplify your data pipeline while improving data governance.</li>
</ul>
<p>See all of these in action with a demo using Preset (powered by Apache Superset) and CelerData (powered by StarRocks). </p>
