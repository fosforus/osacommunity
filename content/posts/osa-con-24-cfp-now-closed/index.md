# OSA Con 2024: CFPs are now closed - thanks to all who submitted.

Thanks to all who submitted talks for this year's event.  It was a great range of ideas, and we wish we could share them all.  We carefully curated the list based on this year's themes and selected a diverse range of speakers.

We hope to see you all there - if you have not already please [register here](https://osacon.io/register/).
