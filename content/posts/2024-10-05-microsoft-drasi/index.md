# Microsoft Drasi simplifies change detection and reaction in complex systems

Microsoft's new open-source project, Drasi, optimizes change detection and automated reactions within complex, event-driven systems. Targeted at IoT, security, and app development, Drasi eliminates the need for manual data collation by integrating directly with sources like Azure Event Grid and PostgreSQL. 

Its framework includes Continuous Queries and automated Reactions, enhancing real-time processing and reducing complexity for developers. Notably, Drasiâ€™s flexible architecture allows custom integrations, making it adaptable to varied operational needs, and it's submitted as a Cloud Native Computing Foundation Sandbox project.
