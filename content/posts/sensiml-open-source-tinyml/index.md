SensiML, a subsidiary of QuickLogic, is opening access to its Analytics Studio, an automated machine learning (AutoML) engine, as open-source software. Previously available as a managed cloud service, Analytics Studio supports a wide range of MCUs and AI-accelerated SoCs for building edge AI/ML applications. By going open source, SensiML aims to enhance its platform, including adding capabilities like GenAI model development and object recognition.

The move to open-source is intended to foster innovation in IoT edge devices, enabling applications like predictive maintenance and anomaly detection. The open-source initiative also seeks to fill a gap in the AI landscape, where existing frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch cater to experts but lack comprehensive end-to-end workflows for AutoML. SensiMLâ€™s tools are designed to streamline the development of TinyML applications, transforming sensor data into actionable insights at the edge.

The team is optimistic about the response from the open-source community. Developers will soon have access to a public GitHub repository, with the official launch expected later this year. SensiML invites interested developers to join the initiative and contribute to the future of edge AI.
